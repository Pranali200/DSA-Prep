A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as recursion.
To prevent infinite recursive calls, if...else statement or similar approach is used.
It uses stack memory.

Advantages:
1. It makes Code shorter.
2. It is used in graph or tree traversal.

Disadvantages:
1. It takes more time and space complexity.
2. Difficult to debug than Iterative function.
